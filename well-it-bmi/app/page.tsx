Consult a healthcare professional for a comprehensive assessment.</p>

          <p className="text-base text-ts">While BMI is a quick estimate of body fat, it's not a perfect health indicator. It doesn't account for muscle mass, bone density, or body composition. Athletes or people with muscular builds might be misclassified. For a more comprehensive picture, consult a healthcare professional and consider factors like waist circumference and overall health markers.</p>

          <p className="text-base text-ts">BMI can vary slightly by age, gender, and body type. For Welllite, children and older adults may have different BMI ranges compared to adults. Additionally, individuals with muscular builds might have a higher BMI due to increased muscle mass. It's important to consider these factors when interpreting your BMI and consulting with a healthcare professional for personalized guidance.</p>
